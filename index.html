          Hi! Welcome to this small little corner of the internet, that is home to my website. Feel free to get yourself a cup of coffee or tea and browse around.
        </p>
        <p>
          Well.... I admit, there's not much going on here yet. But it's all under construction and will soon be the most super duper amazing site on the web. I promise!
        </p>
        <p>
          However, let's not get ahead of ourselves. You are probably here to get to know me better. So... Who am I?
        </p>
        <p>
          My name is Alex (big surprise, I know) and I am currently studying in the Masters course software engineering & internet computing at the <a href="https://www.tuwien.at/en/" title="TU Vienna">Technical University of Vienna</a>. I also work part time as a backend software developer at <a href="https://www.rise-world.com/" title="RISE">RISE</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Currently, the main focus of my studies is distributed systems engineering and quantum computing. However, I also dabbled into other fields of computer science, such as AI (the real stuff, not just machine learning and LLMs) and parallel computing.
        </p>
        <p>
          On the private side of things, I enjoy reading reading books (primarily sci-fi), watching YouTube (guilty as charged), Running (the sport, not the thing you do when encountering difficult life choices), and playing Dodgeball.
        </p>
        <p>
          That's all from my side. If you want to get into contact, feel free to use the links below. I am always happy to talk about computer stuff, books, and everything in between.
