# Alexander Woda - Personal Website

This repository is used to track the development of my personal website you can find at https://www.alexander-woda.com/.

## Repo Structure

The _main_ branch reflects the current state of the published website. The _dev_ branch aggregates feature, bug fix, etc. changes wich themselves are tracked via GitHub Issues and correspondingly named branches. The _dev_ branch is irregularly merged into _main_ to trigger a new release to GitHub Pages.

## Development

To start the development server, run `npm run dev` in the project root. This will open up a site preview with hot reloading at http://localhost:5173/ by default.
